# V79 Academy Course Builder

The **V79 Academy Course Builder** is an enterprise-grade internal course authoring and management platform designed for administrators to create, review, structure, and export online training courses for V79 applications (including Fire Finance Pro, SIWM, Tiquet, and KashDash) before publishing them to the V79 Academy portal.

---

## Features

- **Multi-Application Support**: Author courses for Fire Finance Pro (FFPRO2), SIWM, Tiquet, KashDash, and general tracks.
- **Hierarchical Authoring**: Manage modules, lessons, learning objectives, estimated durations, and markdown content.
- **Interactive Quiz Builder**: Create multiple-choice and true/false quizzes with correct answers and detailed explanations.
- **Asset Manager**: Organize videos, audio files, PDFs, exercises, and downloads by Course, Module, and Lesson.
- **Student-Facing Preview Mode**: Test the complete student experience (landing page, module navigation, lesson viewer, quiz modal, downloads).
- **Automated Export System**: Package courses into structured JSON directories (`course.json`, `modules/`, `quizzes/`, `README.md`) ready for Academy publishing.
- **AI Course Assistant**: Powered by Gemini to auto-generate course outlines, lesson descriptions, and quiz questions.

### V79 Junior Networking Academy

### Course pricing controls

Administrators can set courses to **Free** or **Subscription** and set a USD course price.

- Pricing may be configured before launch.
- Pricing may be changed after launch.
- Free access always normalizes the stored price to `0`.
- Subscription access preserves the administrator's chosen price.
- When a course already has a live website listing, saving a pricing/access change synchronizes the existing website entry before the local change is committed.
- Pricing changes are added to the publishing audit log.

### V79 Junior AI Academy

The repository includes a team-based, subscription-ready AI programme for children ages 6–12 at:

```text
/course/course-junior-ai-academy-01
```

The Junior Academy contains 16 weekly missions across **AI Explorer**, **AI Creator**, and **AI Builder**. It deliberately excludes the later advanced app-development/deployment course.

Key programme features:

- Two age paths inside the same missions: **AI Explorers (6–8)** and **AI Creators (9–12)**.
- **Curriculum v3.1 final mastery standard:** DEFINE → CHOOSE → PROMPT → CHECK → IMPROVE → SAVE.
- Transferable AI skills: task/tool selection, context and constraints, structured outputs, focused follow-ups, prompting, verification, privacy, ethics, images, writing, audio, video, presentations, promotion, workflows, problem solving and supervised entrepreneurship.
- Every mission teaches a mental model, operator moves, real-world use, weak-vs-strong worked example, reusable prompt/workflow pattern, failure modes, deliberate micro-drills, independent transfer task, measurable mastery evidence and an efficiency metric.
- Learners build a reusable **AI Playbook** containing prompt templates, workflows, verification habits, privacy rules and examples of when not to use AI.
- Learners practice conversation/context management: continue when context helps, compress long context into a clean brief, or start a fresh conversation when instructions become messy.
- Mission 16 contains an individual **AI Operator Benchmark** on a brand-new task; new final approval is blocked until every learner submits benchmark evidence. The final review uses a six-part **AI Operator Graduation Rubric** with a recommended minimum of Competent (3/4) in every category.
- Every mission quiz includes scenario questions that test application rather than terminology alone.
- **AI Studio Teams of exactly three** with Leader, Builder and Checker responsibilities.
- Leadership rotation so every learner practices accountability and handover.
- A long-running team project that begins in Mission 1 and becomes the final Demo Day product.
- Age-appropriate project management: goals, milestones, owners, deadlines, **To Do → Doing → Done**, risks and backup plans.
- Younger learners use an **Uh-Oh Plan**; older learners use simple Low/Medium/High risk cards.
- The **CALM** conflict method: Cool down → Ask & listen → Look for fair choices → Make an agreement, with immediate adult escalation for unsafe or serious behavior.
- Weekly Studio Check-Ins with individual contribution reflections and instructor review states: **Submitted → Needs Changes → Approved**.
- Certificate eligibility requires all lessons, all 16 approved weekly team submissions and the individual learner’s reflection for each mission.
- A complete visual pack with 16 mission covers, 16 badges, character cards and Creator Code/MAGIC/STOP/CALM posters.
- Sixteen captioned narrated mission-intro videos generated reproducibly during the production Docker build.

### From Idea to Advantage programme

The repository includes a published, editable Caribbean small-business programme at:

```text
/course/from-idea-to-advantage
```

It contains 12 modules, 36 lessons, 12 module quizzes, 12 practical assignments and a 24-question scenario examination. Its reusable programme layer adds:

- A 40-question **Business Advantage Diagnostic** with separate pre-launch and operating-business wording.
- Eight weighted capability areas with fair service-business wording for purchasing and resource management.
- A starting score, priority modules, final score and category-by-category improvement comparison.
- A 12-section **Business Advantage Workbook** that exports an editable operating plan.
- Evidence-based assessment confidence that increases as workbook sections are completed.
- Certificate eligibility only after 100% lesson completion, all required assignments and a final-exam score of at least 70%.
- Browser-persisted progress that follows the existing Student Portal architecture.

The course is seeded idempotently on first application start. Existing copies are never overwritten, preserving administrator edits and deliberate deletion.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Motion
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: the persistent JSON file store (`data/store.json`). The old Compose PostgreSQL container was unused by the application and has been removed from the service definition. Its existing Docker volume is deliberately left intact; back up the JSON store and learner files before deployment. Do not use `docker compose down -v`.
- **Deployment**: Docker & Docker Compose

---

## Publishing courses to the website

Previously, marking a course "Uploaded" was just a status label - it didn't send anything anywhere. Publishing is now a real action: the **Publish to Website** button (in a course's Settings tab) transforms the course's modules, lessons, and quizzes into the website's expected format and creates or updates the matching entry there via its admin API.

To enable it, set these two environment variables for this app:

- `WEBSITE_SYNC_URL` - the base URL of the website (e.g. `https://vision79.example.com`), no trailing slash.
- `WEBSITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - that website's current admin password.

If the website's admin account still has a pending one-time password (e.g. right after a password reset), log into its `/admin` panel once to set a permanent password before publishing - the publish action will tell you if this is blocking it.

Publishing again after edits updates the same website entry (tracked via `websiteAppId` on the course) rather than creating a duplicate. Course access can be set to **Free** or **Subscription** in Course Builder, and subscription pricing can be changed before or after launch. For already-linked courses, access/pricing changes are synchronized to the existing website entry before the local update is committed.

## Production Deployment (Docker Compose & Nginx Proxy Manager)

> **Important:** The GitHub **Package & Publish Image** workflow validates and publishes the image to GHCR. It does **not** connect to the production server or restart the live containers. Your server/deployment platform must pull/rebuild the new image and start it separately.



To deploy V79 Academy behind Nginx Proxy Manager at **academy.v79sl.com**:

1. **Ensure `proxy_network` exists**:
   ```bash
   docker network create proxy_network || true
   ```

2. **Start the containers**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Configure Nginx Proxy Manager UI (for `academy.v79sl.com`)**:
   - In your **Nginx Proxy Manager UI**:
     - **Domain Names**: `academy.v79sl.com`
     - **Scheme**: `http`
     - **Forward Hostname / IP**: `v79_course_builder` (or server IP)
     - **Forward Port**: `3030`
     - **Websockets Support**: **Enabled** (ON)
     - **Block Common Exploits**: **Enabled** (ON)

> 💡 **Port 3030 & Domain Setup (`academy.v79sl.com`)**:
> - The production Docker image defaults to **port 3030** and exposes **3030**.
> - Docker Compose also sets `PORT=3030`.
> - Public traffic should reach the app only through Nginx Proxy Manager. The container is available internally as `v79_course_builder:3030` on `proxy_network`.
> - If forwarding in Nginx Proxy Manager to container `v79_course_builder`, set **Forward Port** to `3030`.
> - Container/orchestrator health checks may use `/healthz`; a healthy app returns `{"status":"ok"}`.

### Academy portal and memberships

The public learning catalogue is at `/`. Academy authoring and administration live in Hub Admin; the standalone Course Builder browser UI is disabled in production.
Application filters and course counts are calculated from the current catalogue. Creating,
importing, deleting and changing course status refreshes the admin list. The learner catalogue
refreshes on return to the tab and every 30 seconds. Only Published/Uploaded courses appear.
Deleting a linked website course removes its remote entry first; if the website cannot be
reached, deletion returns an error and preserves the local record for retry. Unpublishing a
linked course follows the same rule. Set the Academy app's `ACADEMY_PUBLIC_URL` to
`https://academy.v79sl.com`; website course links are built at `/course/:id`, while the learner catalogue is the domain root.
Set the Hub app's `ACADEMY_PUBLIC_URL` to `https://academy.v79sl.com`.
The Academy setting generates website publication links; existing remote entries should be
republished once to update their links. Curriculum edits still require the explicit Publish action.

Choose **Free** or **Subscription access** in a course's Overview settings. Legacy Premium and
Free Trial courses require a membership rather than silently granting access. Stripe checkout
is deliberately disabled; the app does not collect card details or simulate successful payments.
The **Learners & memberships** admin page supports dated membership grants, extensions,
revocation and password resets. Integrating Stripe Checkout, verified subscription webhooks
and the billing portal is a later setup task; adding a Stripe secret alone does not enable billing.

Learners register with email and a password of at least 12 characters. Their enrolments,
lesson progress, assignment responses, programme work and exam results are persisted in
`data/learners.json`. Include the entire `data` directory in backups. Guest learning remains
available for free courses; guest progress stays in the browser. Old simulated enrolment flags
are never accepted as proof of access. Sessions expire after 12 hours and on application restart.

Quiz and programme exam answers are not returned before submission. Grading is performed
on the server. Certificates check saved lesson completion, required assignment responses and
programme exam results, and are issued to the learner account's name. Assignment submission
records completion, not instructor grading or accreditation.

The old public default recovery key is automatically replaced. Retrieve your private recovery
key from `data/.admin_reset_token.txt` on the server. New installations use `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
or generate a temporary password in `data/.initial_admin_password.txt`. Neither credential is
printed in application logs. Existing administrator passwords are retained.

Validation: `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, then `npm run test:api`. The API tests
use an isolated temporary data directory and never modify production course or learner records.

## Manual server deployment

GitHub Actions validates the repository and the **Package & Publish Image** workflow publishes a validated image to GHCR. It does **not** connect to or restart the production server.

Deploy manually after reviewing a green `main` CI run.

### Deploy from the repository on the server

```bash
git pull
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Deploy from GHCR

Pull `ghcr.io/mrfixitslu/v79acaedmy:latest` (or the commit-tagged image) and restart the course-builder service using your server's normal Compose/runtime procedure.

After deployment verify:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3030/healthz
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

Then sign in to Course Builder and use **Publish to Website** for curriculum changes that should also appear on the public website. Application deployment and course-to-website publication are separate operations.

Before any manual deployment, back up the persistent `data` directory, `.env`, uploads and any external database/storage used by the environment. Do not run `docker compose down -v` unless you explicitly intend to remove volumes.
